The base for this "glitch" is a fork of (@aparrish) Allison Parrish's amazing example using Flat + Bezmerizing to draw SVG.

Lot's of help from Marco Macarena adding the HTML inputs!

This version uses a single flask route, generates and inserts the SVG inside the HTML it serves, a second optional route generates just an SVG.
