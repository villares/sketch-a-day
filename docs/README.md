#### coding a visual idea a day

Welcome! My name is [Alexandre Villares](https://abav.lugaralgum.com) and since January, 2018 I have been coding *sketches* everyday, publishing the source code in the same repository that stores this page, [github.com/villares/sketch-a-day](https://github.com/villares/sketch-a-day). 

The results here are mostly tentative, exploratory, and I don’t feel like they need to be relevant or meaningful on any particular day. The everyday practice leads to the emergence of ideas that I consider interesting, worthy of further exploration. Some of those have been added to [selected work](https://abav.lugaralgum.com/selected-work/index-EN.html), this collection itself became valuable for me, and it is my pleasure to share it with anyone willing to explore coding as a creative and expressive medium.

You can follow me on Mastodon [@villares@ciberlandia.pt](https://ciberlandia.pt/@villares) or at <a rel="me" href="https://pynews.com.br/@villares">@villares@pynews.com.br</a>, where I post most of my daily sketches. Please do not hesitate to [contact me](http://contato.lugaralgum.com) regarding licenses to use my work, teaching opportunities, consulting or other projects.

If you appreciate what I have been doing, you may also support my artistic work, research and open educational resources I publish on-line using the Brazilan PIX key at `46c37783-5edb-4f1c-b3a8-1309db11488c`, [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=5B4MZ78C9J724) or [gumroad.com/villares](https://gumroad.com/villares), where you can subscribe to my [[sketch-mail](https://villares.gumroad.com/l/sketch-mail)] newsletter.

Here are listed some of the tools I have been using:

- [[py5](https://py5coding.org/)] A new Processing Java + Python 3 amazing tool
- [[pyp5js](https://berinhard.github.io/pyp5js/)] initially a Python to p5js trancriptor, now a pyodide + p5js tool

Back to drawing text with colors for highlights. I have an earlier sketch that uses Python's tokenize to draw source with some basic syntax coloring https://github.com/villares/sketch-a-day/tree/main/2023/sketch_2023_08_14, this one is simpler (preparing for another idea).
