#### coding a visual idea a day

Welcome! My name is [Alexandre Villares](https://abav.lugaralgum.com) and since January, 2018 I have been coding *sketches* everyday, publishing the source code in the same repository that stores this page, [github.com/villares/sketch-a-day](https://github.com/villares/sketch-a-day). 

The results here are mostly tentative, exploratory, and I don’t feel like they need to be relevant or meaningful on any particular day. The everyday practice leads to the emergence of ideas that I consider interesting, worthy of further exploration. Some of those have been added to [selected work](https://abav.lugaralgum.com/selected-work/index-EN.html), this collection itself became valuable for me, and it is my pleasure to share it with anyone willing to explore coding as a creative and expressive medium.

You can follow me on Mastodon [@villares@ciberlandia.pt](https://ciberlandia.pt/@villares) or at <a rel="me" href="https://pynews.com.br/@villares">@villares@pynews.com.br</a>, where I post most of my daily sketches. Please do not hesitate to [contact me](http://contato.lugaralgum.com) regarding licenses to use my work, teaching opportunities, consulting or other projects.
